Title: kids jobs to save for Mooloolaba
(1) Description of the problem
we are travelling to Mooloolaba (QLD) for a holiday and want the kids to complete jobs from a list to earn money and save as spending money whilst we are away.
(2) How you solved it
This app allows the children to choose job to complete. When they have completed it, they enter the job from a dropdown list and are credited with the fee for that job. They can also view a list of all the jobs they have completed and also view a running bank balance.
(3) Some information about my technical approach
create a web front end which the children can view and select jobs to complete. Bootstrap front end.
Use js & jquery to link selected data via ajax requests to a firebase database.
